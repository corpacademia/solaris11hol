<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before starting this lab make sure that you either: 

<ol>
	<li>have access to the external Oracle package repository (the output of <code>'pkg list -a | wc -l'</code> should give your more than 3500 packages), or </li>
	<li>have completed Exercise P.0 from IPS Lab and installed the small local repository </li>
</ol></p>

<h2><a id="V.1">Exercise V.1: Zones </a></h2><p><strong>Task:</strong> Your development team wants a separate environment to develop and test their new application. 
</p><p><strong>Lab:</strong> We are going to use Solaris virtualization technology called Solaris Zones.  </p>

<div  style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 800px"><p>60 seconds of theory. Solaris Zones are isolated operating environments, which run inside a single Solaris instance. Each Solaris Zone has its own users, set of processes and applications, hostname and IP address. There are two types of zones: kernel zones and non-kernel zones. In this lab we will be working with non-kernel zones. They use the same kernel that is used by the host Solaris instance, also called "global zone". Each zone has it's own dataset ('zone root') where all system files are installed. Zones can use additional datasets for applications and users' data. By default in Solaris 11 zones use virtual network interface cards (VNICs) and "exclusive IP" which means that networking can be managed both from inside and outside the zone.  </p></div>
<p>When creating a zone we have to define two most important parameters: the zone root's location and the network configuration. In the simplest possible case both of them can be left to their default values. Zone root by default will be located in <code>/system/zones/<em>zonename</em></code>. Of course, you can change that, but in this lab we'll leave it at default. Networking by default is configured as an "automatic VNIC" which is created automatically at the zone's boot time and destroyed after zone halts. By default the zone's IP address is defined inside the zone and quite possibly by a different system administrator. In most datacenter situations though, you would like to control yourself the IP addresses assigned to your zones. This is what we are going to do in this lab.  </p>
<p>Start with this simple command: </p><pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zonecfg -z zone1 </kbd>zone1: No such zone configured Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone. 
<em>OK, if you say so...</em>zonecfg:zone1> <kbd>create</kbd> 
create: Using system default template 'SYSdefault'
</pre>

<p>Let's look at what can be configured and what is already configured:</p>

<pre>
zonecfg:zone1> <kbd>info</kbd>
zonename: zone1
zonepath.template: /system/zones/%{zonename}
zonepath: /system/zones/zone1
brand: solaris
autoboot: false
autoshutdown: shutdown
bootargs: 
file-mac-profile: 
pool: 
limitpriv: 
scheduling-class: 
ip-type: exclusive
hostid: 
tenant: 
fs-allowed: 
anet:
	linkname: net0
	lower-link: auto
	allowed-address not specified
	configure-allowed-address: true
	defrouter not specified
	allowed-dhcp-cids not specified
	link-protection: mac-nospoof
	mac-address: auto
	mac-prefix not specified
	mac-slot not specified
	vlan-id not specified
	priority not specified
	rxrings not specified
	txrings not specified
	mtu not specified
	maxbw not specified
	rxfanout not specified
	vsi-typeid not specified
	vsi-vers not specified
	vsi-mgrid not specified
	etsbw-lcl not specified
	cos not specified
	pkey not specified
	linkmode not specified
	evs not specified
	vport not specified
</pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>zonepath</code> is configured by default and one networking interface, <code>anet</code>, is already there. To make sure the zone's IP address is configured properly, we'll define it here, in zonecfg, along with the default router. In that case we can be sure that it can't be changed from inside the zone (maliciously or by mistake).</p>


<pre>
zonecfg:zone1> <kbd>select anet linkname=net0</kbd>
<em>(In spite of having only one anet, we still have to specify which one we select for configuration) </em>
zonecfg:zone1:anet> <kbd>set allowed-address=10.0.2.21/24</kbd> 
<em>(Use the IP address assigned by your instructor)</em>
zonecfg:zone1:anet> <kbd>set defrouter=10.0.2.2</kbd> 
<em>(Your instructor will give you the default gateway address)</em>
zonecfg:zone1:anet> <kbd>end</kbd>
zonecfg:zone1> <kbd>exit</kbd>
</pre>

 
<p> To check the status of our newly created zone: </p>
<pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm list -cv </kbd>  ID NAME             STATUS     PATH                           BRAND    IP    
   0 global           running    /                              solaris  shared
   - zone1            configured /zones/zone1                   solaris  excl  
 </pre>
 
<p>The zone is configured, we can install and boot it right now. But before the installation we'll 
configure a profile for the Solaris instance which will be running inside the zone. 
By doing that we are avoiding configuring the zone interactively during the first boot. Our zone will be ready for use immediately after start.</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>sysconfig create-profile -o /root/zone1-profile</kbd>
</pre>



<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>sysconfig create-profile -o /root/zone1-profile</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
This command will bring you to the interactive dialog very similar to the standard Solaris installaion. Use F2 to confirm your choices and move from screen to screen. If F2 doesn't work for you, use Esc-2 (press and release Esc and then 2). You will have to enter:
<ul>
<li>Computer Name (hostname for the zone): <kbd>zone1</kbd></li>
<li>Network configuration: choose "<kbd>Automatically</kbd>"</li>
<li>Time zone: choose your time zone from the list</li>
<li>Date: confirm the current date</li>
<li>Root password: <kbd>solaris1</kbd></li>
<li>New user account details: real name, login name and password. This will be the first user of the zone. 
We have entered "<kbd>Zone User</kbd>", "<kbd>zuser</kbd>", "<kbd>oracle1</kbd>"</li>
<li>Other options leave to defaults </li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
Now, when the zone's profile is created, we can install the zone and initialize it using this profile.
</p>

<pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm -z zone1 install -c /root/zone1-profile</kbd> 
A ZFS file system has been created for this zone.
Progress being logged to /var/log/zones/zoneadm.20111113T200358Z.zone1.install
       Image: Preparing at /zones/zone1/root.

 Install Log: /system/volatile/install.4418/install_log
 AI Manifest: /tmp/manifest.xml.NVaaNi
  SC Profile: /root/zone1-profile.xml
    Zonename: zone1
Installation: Starting ...</pre><p>Here you can take a break. The installation will take about 8-10 minutes, depending on your computer.</p>
<pre> ...Long output is skipped... Next Steps: Boot the zone, then log into the zone console (zlogin -C) to complete the configuration process. </pre><p>Check the status again: </p><pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm list -cv</kbd>   ID NAME             STATUS     PATH                           BRAND    IP    
   0 global           running    /                              solaris  shared
   - zone1            installed  /zones/zone1                   solaris  excl  </pre>
<p>It's time to boot our zone: </p><pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm -z zone1 boot </kbd>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm list -cv</kbd>  ID NAME             STATUS     PATH                           BRAND    IP    
   0 global           running    /                              solaris  shared
   1 zone1            running    /zones/zone1                   solaris  excl  
</pre>
<p>
Note the zone's status has changed to "running". 
</p>
<p>Now log into our zone's console (note -C). You will have to wait a couple of minutes while the 
system is initializing services for the first time. While waiting for the zone to boot completely, you can open another terminal window, become root (<code>su -</code>) and login into the zone directly with <code>zlogin zone1</code> This way you don't have to wait for all the services to start, but you can watch the booting process in real time. Run <code>prstat</code> and watch various system services starting one after another.  </p><pre>
root@solaris:~# zlogin -C zone1 [Connected to zone 'zone1' console] </pre><p>You will get the standard Solaris login prompt (you might need to press [Enter] one more time). Congratulations! You've just configured "virtualization within virtualization" using Oracle technologies: Solaris zones within Oracle VirtualBox (or within OVM for SPARC a.k.a. Logical Domains). </p>

<p>
Try to login using <code>root</code>'s credentials (<code>root/solaris1</code>). Here is the result:
</p>

<pre>
zone1 console login: <kbd>root</kbd>
Password: 
Roles can not login directly
Login incorrect
Nov 13 15:23:07 zone1 login: login account failure: Permission denied
</pre>

<p>
A-ha! This is a new Solaris 11 security feature called "root as a role". That means that you can't 
login into a system as "root".
You have to use normal user's credentials and only then you will be able to use "sudo" or "pfexec"
according to your roles and privileges. 
</p>

<p>
Try to login again with <code>zuser/oracle1</code>.

<p>Success!</p>
<p>Note: to escape from the zone's console first type 'exit' to close the session and then at the console prompt use: ~. (tilde period). </p>

<h2><a id="V.2">Exercise V.2: Inside the Zone </a></h2><p><strong>Task:</strong> You have to install some application packages in the zone and create users. </p><p><strong>Lab:</strong> Log in in the zone, create a user and install a web server application.</p> <pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zlogin zone1 </kbd>root@zone1:~# </pre><p>Play around with the usual sysadmin commands. How can you tell if you are in a zone or not? First, try <kbd>ps -ef</kbd>. 
Do you see anything unusual? Yes, you are right, the process IDs don't start with 0, but with some big number. 
Other than that, no visible difference between the normal Solaris installation and the zone. Try <kbd>uname -a, psrinfo, cat /etc/release</kbd>... Check if you can access the Internet by pinging oracle.com. </p><!-- <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: To avoid network congestion during this lab, we have created a local package 
repository inside the virtual appliance. We have used it already during the zone's installation. 
If you are going to use this virtual appliance not only for this lab, please change the package repository settings to the default values. See Final Remarks at the end of this document.</p>  --><p>Now let's do something useful with the zone. Like running a web server, for example. Let's install and run Apache. </p>
<pre>root@zone1:~# <kbd>pkg list -a *apache*</kbd> . . .Skipped. . . web/server/apache-22 2.2.22-0.175.1.0.0.24.0  ---. . .Skipped. . . root@zone1:~# <kbd>pkg install apache-22</kbd> . . .Skipped. . . </pre><p>We've installed it successfully, but it's not running yet. </p><pre>root@zone1:~# <kbd>svcs -a | grep apache</kbd> disabled 6:31:42 svc:/network/http:apache22 </pre><p>Start the Apache web server:</p> <pre>root@zone1:~# <kbd>svcadm enable apache22</kbd> root@zone1:~# svcs -a | grep apache online 6:34:03 svc:/network/http:apache22 </pre><p>Check if it's working from your global Solaris zone (your Solaris desktop): 
start Firefox and enter your zone's IP address into the URL field: 10.0.2.21. "It works!" -- the page usually reads. In our current VirtualBox 
configuration (with NAT networking) the zone is not visible from outside, but you can always try to change your VirtualBox configuration to 
Bridged networking and give your zone an IP address from your local network. (Do try this at home!). 
</p>
<p>Check if it's your zone who is talking. Go back to the zone's terminal 
window and change your web server homepage (I'm using vi here, as we don't have many choices in a freshly installed zone. If you are not 
familiar with vi, check our Vi Quick Reference below): </p>
<pre>root@zone1:~# <kbd>vi /var/apache2/2.2/htdocs/index.html </kbd></pre><p>Write here something like "This is Zone1 and it works!" and save the file. 
Make sure you use '<b>w!</b>' (with the exclamation sign) to save the read-only file. 
Now reload the page in Firefox in your Solaris desktop. Did it work? Congratulations! </p><table width=50% cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" bgcolor="lightgrey">

<p>(It's a small letter L here, not the digit 'one') </p>

<p>
Exit from the <code>ssh</code> session and return back to the global zone. Let's see how zones look from the global zone's perspective. From here you can watch processes in non-global zones by using -Z command line argument in <code>ps(1)</code>. Try this:
</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# ps -efZ
.....Skipped long output...
   zone1     root  4807     1   0 11:47:33 ?           0:00 /usr/lib/ssh/sshd
   zone1     root  4132     1   0 11:47:13 ?           0:00 /usr/lib/rad/rad -sp
   zone1     root  4736     1   0 11:47:30 ?           0:00 /usr/lib/autofs/automountd
   zone1     root  4737  4736   0 11:47:30 ?           0:00 /usr/lib/autofs/automountd
  global     root  4921  1636   0 12:25:04 pts/1       0:00 ps -efZ
   zone1     root  4869     1   0 11:47:37 ?           0:00 /sbin/dhcpagent
</pre>

<p>All processes are tagged with a zone name: it's either "zone1" or "global". Remember to try this command again when you have more zones running (in our next exercises).</p>

<p>Now login again into the zone and try '<code>ps -efZ</code>' inside it. Check if you can see global zone processes from inside the zone. Remember to check this again when you have more zones running. </p>

<p>You may also try the <code>prstat(1M)</code> command with <code>-Z</code> argument and see what happens.</p>
<p>For your homework: compare global and non-global zones installations. How many packages are installed in both?How many services are running? Check if you can login into the global zone with the zone user's (jack) credentials. 
Check if you can use your zone's root password in the global zone (of course, if they are different). </p>

<h2><a id="V.3">Exercise V.3: Zone Cloning </a></h2><p><strong>Task:</strong> Your development team wants a copy of this environment for testing purposes. </p><p><strong>Lab:</strong> We will configure a new zone ('<code>zone2</code>') and then clone it from the existing <code>zone1</code>.

<p>First, configure <code>zone2</code> the same way you've configured <code>zone1</code>:</p>
<pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zonecfg -z zone2 </kbd>zone2: No such zone configured Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone. zonecfg:zone2> <kbd>create</kbd> 
create: Using system default template 'SYSdefault'zonecfg:zone2> <kbd>select anet linkname=net0</kbd>
<em>(In spite of having only one anet, we still have to specify which one we select for configuration) </em>

<em>(Use the IP address assigned by your instructor)</em>
zonecfg:zone2:anet> <kbd>set defrouter=10.0.2.2</kbd> 
<em>(Your instructor will give you the default gateway address)</em>
zonecfg:zone2:anet> <kbd>end</kbd>
zonecfg:zone2> <kbd>exit</kbd>
</pre>


<p>Check:</p> <pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm list -cv</kbd>   ID NAME             STATUS     PATH                           BRAND    IP

   - zone2            configured /zones/zone2                   solaris  excl  
</pre>
<p>Then we create the new zone's profile. Start the System Configuration Tool and repeat 
all the configuration steps you did for <code>zone1</code>. Just change Computer Name to "<code>zone2</code>".</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>sysconfig create-profile -o /root/zone2-profile</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Before cloning we have to shutdown our running <code>zone1</code>:</p>
<pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm -z zone1 shutdown </kbd></pre>
<p>Now clone <code>zone1</code> and configure <code>zone2</code> automatically using this profile: </p><pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm -z zone2 clone -c /root/zone2-profile zone1</kbd> root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm list -cv </kbd>  ID NAME             STATUS     PATH                           BRAND    IP

   1 zone1            installed  /zones/zone1                   solaris  excl  
   2 zone2            installed  /zones/zone2                   solaris  excl  
</pre>

<p>Now boot both zones:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm -z zone1 boot</kbd> 
root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm -z zone2 boot</kbd> 
root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm list -cv </kbd>

amount of processing power to each zone. </p><p><strong>Lab:</strong> We now know how to create and clone zones. Now let's try to cap CPU resources 
in one zone to demonstrate the basics of resource management in Solaris. </p>
<p>First, run a simple CPU-consuming script in the zone1: </p><pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zlogin zone1 "bash -c 'while true ; do date > /dev/null ; done'"</kbd> </pre><p>Note that we are simply using <code>zlogin</code> to pass the command to the zone. </p>
<p>What's going on in the global zone? Open another window, become root and check:</p><pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>vmstat 5 </kbd></pre><p>Idle is 0, system time is around 70%. Not good.</p> <pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zonestat 5</kbd> </pre><p>Zone1 consumes 70-80% of total resources, the rest is spent in global zone (most likely serving <code>zone1</code>'s requests). We decided to reduce the zone1's resource consumption and give it only 50% of our CPU cycles. You can leave the window with <code>zonestat</code> running open and start another terminal session to change the zone's parameters. This way you'll be able to see the changes in real time. </p><pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zonecfg -z zone1</kbd> zonecfg:zone1> <kbd>add capped-cpu</kbd> zonecfg:zone1:capped-cpu> <kbd>set ncpus=0.5 </kbd>zonecfg:zone1:capped-cpu> <kbd>end </kbd>zonecfg:zone1> <kbd>exit</kbd> root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm -z zone1 apply </kbd>
zone 'zone1': Checking: Adding rctl name=zone.cpu-cap
zone 'zone1': Applying the changes</pre><p>Look into another window where you have <code>zonestat</code> running (or run <code>zonestat 5</code> again). You should see the CPU utilization by zone1 dropped down to 50%. </p>

<p>You can check the updated zone1's configuration and see that it's CPU cap is now set to 50%.</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>zonecfg -z zone1 info</kbd>
. . . 
capped-cpu:
	[ncpus: 0.50]
rctl:
	name: zone.cpu-cap
	value: (priv=privileged,limit=50,action=deny)
</pre>
<p>That means next time you run zone1 it will receive 50% of one CPU. It's important to note: it's not 50% of ALL CPUs, it's 50% of only one virtual CPU. In our case in VirtualBox VM we have only one CPU. In most real life cases you will have tens and hundreds of virtual CPUs. Set your values accordingly.</p> 

<p>Is it also possible to change this CPU cap parameter on the fly. This change will be temporary, only until the reboot. </p>
<pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>prctl -n zone.cpu-cap -r -v 25 -i zone zone1 </kbd></pre><p>Check if it works looking in the window with <code>zonestat</code> or running it again: </p><pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zonestat 5 </kbd></pre><p>Don't forget to stop the infinite loop in your zone! Or simply halt the zone. </p><pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>zoneadm -z zone1 halt</kbd> </pre><p>Other resources can be capped this way as well: memory, swap, number of threads etc. Again, think about how it can be used in real life situations? </p>
