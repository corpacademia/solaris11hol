<h1>An Introduction to Oracle Solaris 11</h1> 

<h3><em>Author: Pavel Anni, Oracle</em></h3>
<h4><em>pavel.anni@oracle.com</em></h4><h4><em>February 2013</em></h4>
<h2>Lab Introduction </h2><p>In this lab we introduce the most interesting features of Solaris 11, based on real life use cases. We will: </p><ul>
<li>create a pool and a file system with ZFS; expand it; snapshot and clone it; use ZFS compression and deduplication; </li>
<li>create a new boot environment as a backup, make our current system unbootable because of some fatal mistakes, reboot the system using backup BE;</li>
<li>use new packaging system called IPS to search, install, verify and fix packages; update the system using IPS and Boot Environments together;</li>
<li>use new networking commands, configure virtual network interfaces;</li><li>create a couple of zones; install some applications into them; clone a zone; use Resource Management with the zones; </li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites </h2><p>This lab requires access to a Solaris 11 system either natively or in a VirtualBox virtual machine.</p>
<h3>Using Virtual Box VM</h3> <p>If you're performing this lab on your laptop or desktop, we've provided a VirtualBox appliance that contains 
all the software and configuration necessary to complete this lab. 
All you need is VirtualBox software and a modern (with a CPU supporting virtualization turned on, AMD-V or VT-x) 
laptop/desktop with at least 3 GB of RAM and 10GB of free disk space. </p><ul>
<li>Download and install the latest version of VirtualBox for your platform (http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). </li>
<li>Download and install the latest version of VirtualBox Extensions Pack (http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).</li><li>Download or find on the provided DVD/USB and import the Hands On Lab machine into VirtualBox (File > Import Appliance). 
You will have to accept the OTN Oracle Solaris license to use the appliance. </li></ul>



<h2>The Environment</h2> <p>In this lab we are going to use Oracle Solaris 11 virtual appliance in Oracle VirtualBox environment. 
If you are using lab machines, the appliance is already installed. You can also download the appliance 
from Oracle Technology Network. </p>

<p>The Hands On Lab virtual appliance contains the following: </p><ul>
<li>Solaris 11 installation configured for this lab</li> <li>This lab document</li> 
</ul>

<p>By default, VirtualBox assigns the IP address 10.0.2.15 to the Solaris global zone. 
We will be using also IP addresses 10.0.2.21 and 10.0.2.22 for local zones. As we are using VirtualBox in NAT (network address translation) mode, 
this shouldn't interfere with your outside network environment. </p>

<p>You should login into Solaris desktop with the following credentials: </p>
<p>Username: <code><strong>lab</strong></code> Password: <code><strong>oracle1</strong></code> </p><p>After logging in, open a terminal window and assume the root role: </p><pre>lab@solaris:~$ <strong>su -</strong> </pre>
<p>Password for root is: <code><strong>solaris1</strong></code>. <p>Note: we don't recommend to log in as <code>root</code>. In Solaris 11 it is prohibited by default; 
<code>root</code> is only a role, not a login name.</p>


<h2>Lab Outline </h2>
<p>The labs are independent from each other, you can take them in any order. We just recommend doing all 
exercises in each lab in order.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together </h2><p>The whole idea of this lab is to show you some Solaris 11 features that 
can be used to create a cloud infrastructure based on Solaris. You have just created storage pools and filesystems -- think cloud storage. 
It was fast, it was simple, it was flexible. You have created and cloned Solaris zones with applications within them -- think cloud machine instances. 
You have monitored and managed zones resources -- think cloud elasticity, metering and chargeback. 
We didn't discuss in this lab Solaris network virtualization, 
Solaris security, Solaris package management and many other features 
which make Solaris 11 truly cloud-oriented operating system. Try and learn 
more about Solaris 11 features! </p>

<h2>Final Notes</h2>

<p>The virtual appliance we used in this lab is configured to be able to perform zone installation without network access. 
Namely, we've configured an internal repository with just a small subset of packages necessary for zone installations. 
If you are going to continue using this appliance with open network access, you will need to change the repository address
to Oracle's standard Solaris repository.  </p>
