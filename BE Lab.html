<h2><a id="B.1">Exercise B.1: Boot Environments</a></h2>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> You want to make updates to your system, but you want to be able to return back to the previous state.</p>

<p><strong>Lab:</strong> We will use a Solaris 11 feature called Boot Environments. We'll create an extra boot environment 
as a backup (think saving your state in a shooting game). Then we'll make some fatal mistakes which make our system unbootable. 
After we failed to boot our default boot environment, we'll boot into the backup BE. </p>

<p>The only command you want to know to work with Boot Environments is <code>beadm(1M)</code>. Start with 
showing all boot environments in the system:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm list</kbd>
BE      Active Mountpoint Space Policy Created          
--      ------ ---------- ----- ------ -------          
solaris NR     /          6.87G static 2011-11-14 13:13 
</pre>

<p>Create a new boot environment:</p>

<pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm create solaris-backup</kbd></pre>


<p>Check the status again:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm list</kbd>
BE          Active Mountpoint Space   Policy Created          
--          ------ ---------- -----   ------ -------          
solaris       NR    /          7.13G  static 2011-11-14 13:13 
solaris-backup      -        126.14M  static 2011-11-15 11:09 
</pre>

<p>Now pretend you are making some changes in the system configuration, creating and removing directories, and... 
 Somebody has distracted you and instead of removing a temporary directory, you have typed:</p>
 
 <pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>rm -rf /etc/</kbd> 
</pre>

<p>What??? You just have destroyed the whole /etc directory! All the configuration files are gone! (If you are brave enough, 
you can remove /usr/bin too!) You have killed your system! Try to "Power Off" your virtual machine and reboot it--you'll see
 it won't boot. Don't wait too long, 3-5 minutes is enough to be sure that it doesn't boot. 
 Hint: While waiting for the system to reboot, press the [ESC] key to see the error messages.</p>

<p>
No worries! We have a backup! And you don't have to go and find the backup tape in your fireproof cabinet, go through all the 
hassles of restoring the unbootable system... Just when your VirtualBox VM shows you the GRUB menu, choose the "solaris-backup" item
instead of the "Oracle Solaris 11.1" which is the default. </p>

<p>It boots again! What a relief!</p>

<p>What now? List your boot environments again:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm list</kbd>
BE          Active Mountpoint Space   Policy Created          
--          ------ ---------- -----   ------ -------          
solaris        R    /          7.13G  static 2011-11-14 13:13 
solaris-backup N      -        126.14M  static 2011-11-15 11:09 
</pre>

<p>What does it mean? It means that you are now running 'solaris-backup' boot environment,
but at the next reboot the system will try to boot the 'solaris' boot environment,
 which is corrupted. Let's fix that. The plan is: activate your current BE, delete the 'solaris' BE (as it's
 corrupted anyway), create a new 'solaris' BE and activate it.</p>
 
<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm activate solaris-backup</kbd>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm destroy solaris</kbd>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm create solaris</kbd>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm activate solaris</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Check your work:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm list</kbd>
BE             Active Mountpoint Space  Policy Created          
--             ------ ---------- -----  ------ -------          
solaris        R      -          6.05G  static 2012-11-14 16:35 
solaris-backup N      /          275.5K static 2012-11-14 16:22 

</pre>

<p>Now you've got everything back. You can safely reboot into 'solaris' BE or 
you can continue working in 'solaris-backup' until next reboot.</p>

<p>Boot Environments have many applications: you can update your system, 
installing packages into inactive boot environment; create boot environment snapshots etc. We leave it
for your homework. </p>
