<h1><a id="top">Oracle Solaris 11 Boot Environments Lab</a></h1>

<h2><a id="B.1">Exercise B.1: Boot Environments</a></h2>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> You want to make updates to your system, but you want to be able to return back to the previous state.</p>

<p><strong>Lab:</strong> We will use a Solaris 11 feature called Boot Environments. We'll create an extra boot environment 
as a backup (think saving your state in a shooting game). Then we'll make some fatal mistakes which make our system unbootable. 
After we failed to boot our default boot environment, we'll boot into the backup BE. </p>

<p>The only command you want to know to work with Boot Environments is <code>beadm(1M)</code>. Start with 
showing all boot environments in the system:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm list</kbd>
BE      Active Mountpoint Space Policy Created          
--      ------ ---------- ----- ------ -------          
solaris NR     /          6.87G static 2011-11-14 13:13 
</pre>

<p>Create a new boot environment:</p>

<pre>root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm create solaris-backup</kbd></pre>


<p>Check the status again:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm list</kbd>
BE          Active Mountpoint Space   Policy Created          
--          ------ ---------- -----   ------ -------          
solaris       NR    /          7.13G  static 2011-11-14 13:13 
solaris-backup      -        126.14M  static 2011-11-15 11:09 
</pre>

<p>Now pretend you are making some changes in the system configuration, creating and removing directories, and... 
 Somebody has distracted you and instead of removing a temporary directory, you have typed:</p>
 
 <pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>rm -rf /usr</kbd> 
</pre>

<p>What??? You just have destroyed the whole /usr directory! You have killed your system! Try '<code>ls</code>' or '<code>ps</code>' or any normal command. What do you see? Even if you try to reboot your system using '<code>init 6</code>', the result is the same: "Command not found". Try to "Power Off" your virtual machine and reboot it--you'll see
 it won't boot. Don't wait too long, 3-5 minutes is enough to be sure that it doesn't boot. 
 Hint: While waiting for the system to reboot, press the [ESC] key to see the error messages.</p>

<p>
No worries! We have a backup! And you don't have to go and find the backup tape in your fireproof cabinet, go through all the hassles of restoring the unbootable system... Just when your VirtualBox VM shows you the GRUB menu, choose the "solaris-backup" item instead of the "Oracle Solaris 11.2" which is the default. </p>

<div style="background-color: #dddddd"><p><strong>SPARC version.</strong> If you are using a SPARC system for this lab (for example, in Oracle Solutions Center we use logical domains for that) then you need console access to be able to choose a different Boot Environment. In the case of LDoms, you have to login in the Control Domain and stop your guest domain with <code>'ldm stop lab0'</code> (or whatever domain name you are using). Then make sure the domain will not auto-boot: <code>'ldm set-var auto-boot\?=false lab0'</code> and start the domain again: <code>'ldm start lab0'</code>. Now you can access the domain's console via <code>'telnet localhost 5000'</code>. You will see the familiar <code>'ok'</code> prompt. Then use 'boot -L' to list existing Boot Environments.</p>

<pre>
{0} ok <kbd>boot -L</kbd>
Boot device: /virtual-devices@100/channel-devices@200/disk@0:a  File and args: -L
1 solaris
2 solaris-backup
Select environment to boot: [ 1 - 2 ]: 2

To boot the selected entry, invoke:
boot [<root-device>] -Z rpool/ROOT/solaris-backup

Program terminated
{0} ok <kbd>boot -Z rpool/ROOT/solaris-backup</kbd>
</pre>

</div>
<p><br> It boots again! What a relief!</p>

<p>What now? List your boot environments again:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm list</kbd>
BE          Active Mountpoint Space   Policy Created          
--          ------ ---------- -----   ------ -------          
solaris        R    /          7.13G  static 2011-11-14 13:13 
solaris-backup N      -        126.14M  static 2011-11-15 11:09 
</pre>

<p>What does it mean? It means that you are now running 'solaris-backup' boot environment,
but at the next reboot the system will try to boot the 'solaris' boot environment,
 which is corrupted. Let's fix that. The plan is: activate your current BE, delete the 'solaris' BE (as it's
 corrupted anyway), create a new 'solaris' BE and activate it.</p>
 
<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm activate solaris-backup</kbd>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm destroy solaris</kbd>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm create solaris</kbd>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm activate solaris</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Check your work:</p>

<pre>
root@solaris:~# <kbd>beadm list</kbd>
BE             Active Mountpoint Space  Policy Created          
--             ------ ---------- -----  ------ -------          
solaris        R      -          6.05G  static 2012-11-14 16:35 
solaris-backup N      /          275.5K static 2012-11-14 16:22 

</pre>

<p>Now you've got everything back. You can safely reboot into 'solaris' BE or 
you can continue working in 'solaris-backup' until next reboot.</p>

<p>Boot Environments have many applications: you can update your system, 
installing packages into inactive boot environment; create boot environment snapshots etc. We leave it
for your homework. </p>
